#### Current state of development

The app is in a functional state. Most features are present. There can be still some display errors on some news items. To support the development you can turn on developer mode in app settings.

With this option you are able to save the news item data for debugging purpose. Also a screenshot would be helpful.


#### Features

-     News Reader
-     Audio Player
-     Video Player

#### Intention of this project

This app is part of my plan to replace all android apps I use with native ones. If they don't exist, I will try to create one.
